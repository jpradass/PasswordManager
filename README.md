# PasswordManager
Tool to manage passwords and keep them safe and encrypted in a remote mongo database. 

## TO DO List
1. Configure a time range for this service to warn if a password overpass that limit
2. Create a password generator based on a list of common words from internet (better than random pc generated passwords)
3. Store services.json in a service as AWS S3 or whatever that could be accessible everywhere, independent of my pc
4. Flush command to remove all services stored and a delete command to remove only one service
